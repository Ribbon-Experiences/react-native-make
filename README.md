## About the fork

Here are the differences from the upstream:
- setIcon now exits the process with code 1 when sharp throws errors, 
- non rectangular image is now resized as expected, previously it was ignored and no icon was generated,
- alpha is now removed using flatten rather than removeAlpha which produces very ugly results
- updated dependencies

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

In your react-native project folder, run:

```bash
yarn add -D Ribbon-Experiences/react-native-make
# OR
npm i -D Ribbon-Experiences/react-native-make
```
And go into your package.json and edit the `@momence/react-native-make` into `"@bam.tech/react-native-make":`. THis is needed for this to work in react-native as a plugin.

**Please note:** This plugin only supports react-native-cli v2+

## üìö Usage

Once installed, plugins are available through the React Native CLI

You can get the list of available plugins by running `react-native -h` within your project's folder

|                            Command | Description                               |
| ---------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------- |
|     [set-icon](./docs/set-icon.md) | generate platform specific app icons      |
| [set-splash](./docs/set-splash.md) | generate platform specific splash screens |

## üíª Local development

- Pull latest version
- `cd react-native-make`
- Run `yarn` then `yarn link`
- Launch a new project with `react-native init`
- In your React Native project, `yarn link @bam.tech/react-native-make`
- In the package.json of your React Native project, in dependencies add "@bam.tech/react-native-make" : "0.0.0"

## Changes in 3.0.0

Since 3.0.0, splashscreens for iOS are created via Xcode‚Äôs storyboard, so as to meet Apple's new requirements as of April 2020.
